This is a relatively simple Android App, where you can configure a bunch of dummy settings pages using a JSON import.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Theaninova/Kontrol/wiki/JSON-Schema) on how to create JSON files to configure pages in the app.

## iOS

No. Sorry. That's a complete rewrite unfortunately, a system I am completely unfamiliar with, and one that requires having a Mac just to compile an app, and horrendous fees for publishing it. So no.
